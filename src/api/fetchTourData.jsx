Bordered by France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Liechtenstein, this small yet mighty country boasts breathtaking landscapes, including majestic mountains, crystal-clear lakes, and picturesque valleys.

One of Switzerland's most iconic features is its towering Alps, which dominate much of the country's landscape.
